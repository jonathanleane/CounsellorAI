# CounsellorAI Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the CounsellorAI application, its architecture, features, and implementation details.

## Project Status

CounsellorAI has been successfully rebuilt with modern architecture and enhanced security features. The application is designed for both:
- **Online use**: Deploy to cloud services with Firebase support
- **Local use**: Run with SQLite for maximum privacy

Users provide their own API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google AI services.

## Quick Start for Rebuild

1. Review the architecture overview
2. Set up the project structure per the migration guide
3. Implement backend services following the API documentation
4. Build frontend components using the UI/UX patterns
5. Integrate AI services per the integration guide
6. Test thoroughly using the implementation notes

## Key Improvements Completed

### Security Enhancements ✅
1. **API Keys**: Moved to environment variables with validation
2. **PII Protection**: Automatic redaction in logs
3. **Input Sanitization**: Prompt injection protection
4. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection

### Architecture Improvements ✅
1. **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
2. **Lazy Loading**: AI providers initialized on demand
3. **Firebase Support**: Complete integration with migration tools
4. **Structured Logging**: Winston with PII filtering

### Remaining Priorities
1. **Database Encryption**: Encrypt SQLite at rest
2. **Export Formats**: Add PDF and Markdown
3. **Crisis Management**: Enhanced detection and resources
4. **Search**: Full-text search in conversations
5. **Voice Support**: Speech input/output
6. **Mobile Apps**: Native applications

## Current State

The application has been successfully rebuilt with:
1. ✅ Core backend services with TypeScript
2. ✅ React frontend with Material-UI
3. ✅ Multi-model AI integration (GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini)
4. ✅ Security features (PII redaction, injection protection)
5. ✅ Firebase and SQLite support
6. ✅ Comprehensive testing suite

Ready for community contributions and further enhancements.
