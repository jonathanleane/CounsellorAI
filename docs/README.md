# AI Therapist Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI Therapist application to enable rebuilding it from scratch with improvements.

## Project Goals

This project will be **open source** and designed for both:
- **Online use**: Deploy to cloud services for easy access
- **Local use**: Run completely offline for maximum privacy

Users will provide their own API keys for OpenAI/Anthropic services.

## Quick Start for Rebuild

1. Review the architecture overview
2. Set up the project structure per the migration guide
3. Implement backend services following the API documentation
4. Build frontend components using the UI/UX patterns
5. Integrate AI services per the integration guide
6. Test thoroughly using the implementation notes

## Key Improvements to Make

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Security**: Move API keys to environment variables
2. **TypeScript**: Add type safety throughout
3. **Authentication**: Implement user system
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test suite

### Architecture Enhancements
1. **Microservices**: Separate AI processing
2. **Caching**: Add Redis for performance
3. **Queue System**: Async message processing
4. **WebSockets**: Real-time updates

### Feature Additions
1. **Export**: Conversation export functionality
2. **Analytics**: Usage and insight dashboards
3. **Voice**: Speech input/output
4. **Mobile**: Native applications

## Migration Path

The application can be rebuilt incrementally:
1. Start with core backend services
2. Implement basic frontend
3. Add AI integration
4. Layer on advanced features
5. Optimize and deploy

Total estimated time: 5-6 weeks for complete rebuild with improvements.
