# CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE - PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Database Encryption Still Required

**Date**: June 2025 (Updated)  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: All user therapy data is stored unencrypted

## Recent Security Fixes (Completed)

### ✅ Recently Fixed Issues (2025-06-13):
1. **Server Crash on Missing API Keys** - Server now starts with any subset of AI providers
2. **Input Validation** - Added Zod validation to ALL API endpoints
3. **PII in Logs** - Created and applied redaction utility
4. **SQL Injection** - Fixed with field whitelisting
5. **CSRF Protection** - Implemented double-submit cookie pattern
6. **Memory Leaks** - Fixed conversation timer cleanup
7. **Request Size Limits** - Added 1MB limits to prevent DoS

### ❌ NOT Fixed (Critical):
1. **Database Encryption** - All therapy data still in plaintext
2. **Authentication System** - No login/access control
3. **Session Timeouts** - Sessions never expire

### ❌ Still Required:
1. **Database Encryption** - SQLite still stores data in plaintext

## Summary

A security audit has identified that CounsellorAI currently stores all therapy session data, personal information, and mental health records in an unencrypted SQLite database. This is a critical security vulnerability that must be addressed before any production use.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. For Current Users (if any)
- **STOP** using the application for sensitive data until encryption is implemented
- Export and securely delete any existing data
- Wait for the security update before continuing use

### 2. For Developers
- Do NOT deploy this application to production without implementing encryption
- Review the `ENCRYPTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` file for implementation details
- Test thoroughly before releasing the update

## Technical Details

### Current State
- Database location: `/database/counsellor.db`
- Storage format: Plain SQLite with no encryption
- Risk: Anyone with file system access can read all therapy data

### Recommended Solution
Implement `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` with ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption:

```bash
npm install better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers
```

Generate a strong encryption key:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Add to `.env`:
```
DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-generated-key-here
```

## Timeline
- **Immediate**: Add this warning to README
- **24-48 hours**: Implement basic encryption
- **1 week**: Complete migration and testing
- **2 weeks**: Release encrypted version

## Additional Security Issues

1. **JSON String Storage**: Structured data is stored as JSON strings instead of proper database fields
2. **Partial Input Validation**: Some endpoints have Zod validation, others still vulnerable
3. **Documentation Conflicts**: SECURITY.md incorrectly claims encryption exists
