### Prerequisites (What You Need)

Before starting, you'll need:

1. **A Computer** (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

3. Download will start automatically
4. Double-click the downloaded file

### Step 3: Get Your AI API Key

     - **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + .` (period)
4. **Make a copy of `.env.example`** and rename it to `.env` (remove the .example part)
5. **Open the `.env` file** with any text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac)
6. You'll see something like this:
   ```
   # OpenAI Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
