## üöÄ Complete Setup Guide for Beginners

Don't worry if you're not tech-savvy! This guide will walk you through every step.

### Prerequisites (What You Need)

Before starting, you'll need:

1. **A Computer** (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
2. **Internet Connection** (for downloading and AI responses)
3. **An AI API Key** (we'll show you how to get one - it's like a password for the AI)

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Node.js is what makes the app run. Think of it as the engine.

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the "LTS" version (the big green button)
3. Run the installer - just click "Next" for everything
4. To check it worked, open Terminal/Command Prompt and type: `node --version`

### Step 2: Get an AI API Key

You need at least ONE of these (they're free to start):

#### Option A: OpenAI (GPT-4o)
1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Click "API Keys" in the left menu
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)
6. **Save it somewhere safe!** You can't see it again

#### Option B: Anthropic (Claude)
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to "API Keys"
4. Create a new key
5. Copy and save it

#### Option C: Google (Gemini)
1. Go to [makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with Google
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy and save it

### Step 3: Download CounsellorAI

1. Click the green "Code" button on this page
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop or Documents folder

### Step 4: Set Up Your Configuration

1. In the CounsellorAI folder, find the file called `.env.example`
2. Make a copy and rename it to `.env` (remove the `.example` part)
3. Open it with any text editor (Notepad is fine)
4. Add your API key(s) and security keys:
   ```
   # AI API Keys (at least one required)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key-here
   
   # Security Keys (generate random values)
   DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=generate-a-32-character-random-string
   JWT_SECRET=generate-another-32-character-random-string
   CSRF_SECRET=generate-another-32-character-random-string
   ```
5. To generate random security keys:
   - On Mac/Linux: Run `openssl rand -base64 32` in Terminal
   - On Windows: Use an online generator like [randomkeygen.com](https://randomkeygen.com/)
   - Or just type 32 random characters (mix of letters, numbers, symbols)
6. Save the file

### Step 5: Install and Run

1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
2. Navigate to the CounsellorAI folder:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/CounsellorAI
   ```
3. Install everything:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:5173`

That's it! You should see the login page. Create an account (it's stored locally on your computer) and start chatting!
